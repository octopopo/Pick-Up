Finish making three kinds of object: Pick-Up, Power-Up, Weapon
Decide to make two versions of object for each weapons, one is one the ground for player to pick, another is for player to use (haven't made yet)

Add an empty object under the player as player's hand
Since there will be two versions of weapons, the pickup versions wouldn't have to carry to much information except for the type of weapon(to-do)
